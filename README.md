# ClerksWell Charity Hackathon 2025
## Challenge Selection
We have chosen Challenge 2 for the duration of this hackathon, which focuses on improving support for families through Restore Hope.

## Overview
Our goal is to make it easier for people with low digital confidence to engage with Restore Hope’s services. Many families struggle with online forms or account creation, so we are building a solution that removes these barriers to make things more simple and accessible.

## Solution
We will be using Umbraco 17 and Twilio to allow families to call and access information about all groups, courses and other support services, they will be able to book into these events. 

We will be able to track their engagement with Restore Hope under their phone number so inderviduals will not need to go through complex account creation.
