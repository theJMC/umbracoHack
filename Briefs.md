# Challenge 1: Headway – Supporting Life After Brain Injury
## The Challenge:
Living with a brain injury can be incredibly tough and often misunderstood. Survivors may experience memory loss, fatigue, or difficulty concentrating, which can make everyday tasks feel overwhelming. Headway’s Brain Injury Identity Card helps explain these hidden challenges, but it’s a physical card in a digital world.
Your mission is to explore how technology could support brain injury survivors in their day-to-day lives.
How can we make the ID card more accessible? How might we help people feel more confident and independent? What would a digital companion look like for someone navigating life after a brain injury?
### What to focus on:
- Making support more accessible, especially in moments of stress or confusion
- Helping people explain their condition when they need to
- Providing reassurance, guidance, or useful information in a way that’s easy to understand
- Designing for users who may have cognitive challenges or fatigue
### Inspiration to Get You Started:
- Could there be a digital version of the ID card that’s easy to show when needed?
- What if users could ask questions and get helpful, personalised responses?
- Could the tool offer location-based support or signpost to nearby services?
- How might it help someone manage their condition day-to-day?
### Judging Criteria:
- Usability – Is it intuitive and accessible for the intended audience?
- Creativity – Does it bring a fresh perspective or unexpected idea?
- Understanding of the Brief – Does it show empathy for the challenges faced by brain injury survivors?
- Progress Toward a Working Version – How far did you get in bringing the idea to life?
- Integrations – Bonus points for clever use of APIs or data sources (e.g., Headway content or Salesforce)
- Use of Umbraco 17 – You need to use Umbraco 17 in some way. You can be creative.
You don’t need to build a full app. A web-based tool, a prototype, or even a concept with a clear user flow is more than enough. Think big, start small, and show us what’s possible.

# Challenge 2: Restore Hope – A Dignified Digital Experience for Families
## The Challenge:
Restore Hope supports families facing tough times. Offering food, community events, and life-changing programmes. One of their standout services is the Dignity Supermarket, where families can buy £25 worth of goods for just £5. But as more families engage, it’s getting harder to manage access, track participation, and understand the impact of their work.
Your mission is to imagine a digital way to bring it all together.
How can families access services in a way that feels simple, respectful, and empowering? How can staff and volunteers easily see who’s engaging and how they’re progressing? How can we make the experience better for everyone involved?
### What to focus on:
- Making it easy for families to access services and track their own journey
- Helping staff and volunteers manage participation without adding complexity
- Ensuring the experience is inclusive, mobile-friendly, and easy to use
- Respecting privacy and promoting dignity at every step
### Inspiration to Get You Started:
- Could families have a digital membership or access pass?
- What might a simple check-in or booking system look like?
- Could there be a way to track engagement and show progress over time?
- How might the system support families with low digital confidence?
### Judging Criteria:
- Usability – Is it easy to use for both families and staff?
- Creativity – Does it offer a fresh take on how to support and empower users?
- Understanding of the Brief – Does it reflect Restore Hope’s values of dignity and simplicity?
- Progress Toward a Working Version – How far did you get in building or demonstrating your idea?
- Integrations – Bonus points for smart thinking around data, workflows, or systems like Salesforce
- Use of Umbraco 17 – You need to use Umbraco 17 in some way. You can be creative.
You don’t need to build a full app. A web-based tool, a prototype, or even a concept with a clear user flow is more than enough. Think big, start small, and show us what’s possible.
